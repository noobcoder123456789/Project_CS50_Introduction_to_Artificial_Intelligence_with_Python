# Background

**Minesweeper**

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.

In this 3x3 Minesweeper game, for example, the three `1` values indicate that each of those cells has one neighboring cell that is a mine. The four `0` values indicate that each of those cells has no neighboring mine.

Given this information, a logical player could conclude that there must be a mine in the lower-right cell and that there is no mine in the upper-left cell, for only in that case would the numerical labels on each of the other cells be accurate.

The goal of the game is to flag (i.e., identify) each of the mines. In many implementations of the game, including the one in this project, the player can flag a mine by right-clicking on a cell (or two-finger clicking, depending on the computer).

# Propositional Logic

Your goal in this project will be to build an AI that can play Minesweeper. Recall that knowledge-based agents make decisions by considering their knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge.

One way we could represent an AI’s knowledge about a Minesweeper game is by making each cell a propositional variable that is true if the cell contains a mine, and false otherwise.

What information does the AI have access to? Well, the AI would know every time a safe cell is clicked on and would get to see the number for that cell. Consider the following Minesweeper board, where the middle cell has been revealed, and the other cells have been labeled with an identifying letter for the sake of discussion.

What information do we have now? It appears we now know that one of the eight neighboring cells is a mine. Therefore, we could write a logical expression like the below to indicate that one of the neighboring cells is a mine.

```
Or(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)
```

But we actually know more than what this expression says. The above logical sentence expresses the idea that at least one of those eight variables is true. But we can make a stronger statement than that: we know that exactly one of the eight variables is true. This gives us a propositional logic sentence like the below.

```
Or(
    And(A, Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), B, Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), C, Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), D, Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), E, Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), F, Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), G, Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), H)
)
```

That’s quite a complicated expression! And that’s just to express what it means for a cell to have a `1` in it. If a cell has a `2` or `3` or some other value, the expression could be even longer.

Trying to perform model checking on this type of problem, too, would quickly become intractable: on an 8x8 grid, the size Microsoft uses for its Beginner level, we’d have 64 variables, and therefore $2^{64}$ possible models to check – far too many for a computer to compute in any reasonable amount of time. We need a better representation of knowledge for this problem.
